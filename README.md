# StoryBooks

This is a NodeJS app using Express. 
The idea here is to let users (signed in using their Google accounts) to add stories. These stories can then be kept private, or made public, where other users can comment on them. 

The application is live on: https://blooming-earth-48561.herokuapp.com/

PS: This is still under progress. Feel free to create a PR if you see any bugs. Ignore frontend mistakes
